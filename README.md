# House-Price-Prediction
House is the primary need of everyone. Almost everyone when starting to start a family chooses to buy a house, this indicates that the need to own a home will increase over time. Buying a house is commonly the most important financial transaction for the average person. The fact that most prices are negotiated individually (unlike a stock exchange system) creates an environment that results in an inefficient system. That's why many of real estate agency using house prediction concept to drive the efficiency of house pricing.

## About
This project using The Boston Housing Dataset. The Boston Housing Dataset is a derived from information collected by the U.S. Census Service concerning housing in the area of Boston MA. From this dataset, we want to predict the house price (medv) using some features. The following describes the dataset columns / features: 
1. CRIM - per capita crime rate by town
2. ZN - proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
3. INDUS - proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
4. CHAS - Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
5. NOX - nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
6. RM - average number of rooms per dwelling
7. AGE - proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
8. DIS - weighted distances to five Boston employment centres
9. RAD - index of accessibility to radial highways
10. TAX - full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
11. PTRATIO - pupil-teacher ratio by town
12. BLACK - the proportion of blacks by town
13. LSTAT - % lower status of the population
14. MEDV - Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's

## Method
**1. Simple Linear Regression**
Simple Linear Regression is a type of regression algorithms that models the relationship between a dependent / response variable  and a single independent / predictor variable. We can also use regression to predict the values of a response variable (ŷ) based on the values of the important predictor (x). 
>ŷ = b0 + b1 x


## Step Using Python
1. Split The Data
2. Model Training & Coefficient Obtained
3. Model Diagnostics


## Requirements
