# House-Price-Prediction
House is the primary need of everyone. Almost everyone when starting to start a family chooses to buy a house, this indicates that the need to own a home will increase over time. Buying a house is commonly the most important financial transaction for the average person. The fact that most prices are negotiated individually (unlike a stock exchange system) creates an environment that results in an inefficient system. That's why many of real estate agency using house prediction concept to drive the efficiency of house pricing.

## About
This project using student study hour dataset from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/himanshunakrani/student-study-hours). The dataset contains two columns. that is the number of hours student studied and the marks they got. We can apply simple linear regression to predict the marks of the student given their number of study hours. predict the house price with several features using multiple linear regression, regularized linear regression, and random forest regression


## Simple Linear Regression
Simple Linear Regression is a type of regression algorithms that models the relationship between a dependent / response variable  and a single independent / predictor variable. We can also use regression to predict the values of a response variable (ŷ) based on the values of the important predictor (x). 
>ŷ = b0 + b1 x


## Step Using Python
